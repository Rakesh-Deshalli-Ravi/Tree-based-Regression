# Tree-based-Regression
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of Tree-Based Regression in Python. The code demonstrates core concepts including data loading, tree node creation, binary splitting, pruning, and prediction. It showcases the fundamental principles of decision tree regression without relying on external machine learning libraries.


# Tree-Based Regression Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of Tree-Based Regression built from scratch. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts behind decision tree regression algorithms.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Tree node creation and binary splitting
- Pruning functionality
- Prediction using the constructed tree
- Visualization of regression results

## Files

- `TreeBasedRegression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and examples

## Usage

To use this implementation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `TreeBasedRegression.ipynb` Jupyter notebook
3. Run the cells to see the tree-based regression algorithm in action

## Learning Outcomes

This project helps in understanding:

- How decision trees work for regression problems
- The process of recursively splitting data to create a tree structure
- Pruning techniques to prevent overfitting
- Making predictions using a decision tree

## Implementation Details

The tree-based regression implementation includes:

- `treeNode`: Class for creating tree nodes
- `binSplitDataSet`: Function for binary splitting of datasets
- `createTree`: Main function for constructing the regression tree
- `prune`: Function for tree pruning
- `regTreeEval` and `modelTreeEval`: Functions for evaluating leaf nodes
